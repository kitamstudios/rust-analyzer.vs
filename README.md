# rust-analyzer.vs - Rust language support for Visual Studio 2022

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I wrote this extension for my pet Rust projects. Features / fixes implemented as & when I need them. That is the entire scope of the project. But made it free & OSS just in case anyone finds it useful.
> Of late have been getting 'requests' from rather entitled set of users that do not have the spirit of giving back (e.g. [this](https://github.com/kitamstudios/rust-analyzer.vs/issues/56), [this](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/185a78cb-d04d-46b7-b68d-745802258597) and [this](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc7e2c7f-64f2-4c1a-98d1-4b50c53d34c4)). If you have similar attitude, don't use this extension.

> You can contribute to the project with working code **OR** pay me to build your fav features **OR** do not use this extension. Abusive, unpleasant or derogatory attitude will get you banned from this project.

Download this extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace][marketplace] or get the [CI build][vsixgallery].

**For a superior Rust development experience install the [Rust Development Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kitamstudios.RustDevelopmentPack) (includes this extension along with few other useful extensions).**

## Principles

1. Drive developer towards Rust community best practices.
1. UI and behavior parity with 'Open Folder' experience for a C# solution with multiple projects (unless it contradicts #1).
1. Enhance with Rust community tools sets e.g. fmt, clippy, examples, docs. etc.
1. Killer features e.g. ChatGPT integration.

## Features

- [Workspaces & super workspaces both fully supported (super workspace is a folder with multiple cargo workspaces).](https://youtu.be/pE1Vr2zVCbg?t=80)

- [Debug & Run without debugging.](https://youtu.be/pE1Vr2zVCbg?t=1424)
- [Run, debug & manage unit tests from test explorer.](https://youtu.be/pE1Vr2zVCbg?t=379)
- [Examples support (run & debug).](https://youtu.be/pE1Vr2zVCbg?t=1311)
- [Set additional properties for build / debug / run (e.g. command line arguments).](https://youtu.be/pE1Vr2zVCbg?t=1469)

- Infrastructure features
  - [Extension Logs for debugging in Output | rust-analyzer.vs pane.](https://youtu.be/pE1Vr2zVCbg?t=129)
  - [Test integration requires changes currently in rust nightly toolchain. RFC is in progress to promote the changes to stable. Refer: https://](https://youtu.be/pE1Vr2zVCbg?t=379)
  - [Tools | Options | rust-analyzer.vs](https://youtu.be/pE1Vr2zVCbg?t=1225)

> These features continue to get tested with top Rust OSS projects like [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo), [ruffle](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle), [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced), [geo](https://github.com/georust/geo), [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff), [reqwest](https://github.com/seanmonstar/reqwest), [wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime). There are bugs! ðŸ˜‰

### Upcoming

- Cross compilation (wasm, linux, etc.) / build & run on WSL2 / leverage docker.
- Test experience enhancements (document and benchmark tests).

### Probably never

- Basic project templates.
- ChatGPT integration.
- Folder enhancements (icons, context menus).
- crates.io integration.
- cargo management.

## How can I help?

If you enjoy using the extension, please give it a â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜…â˜… rating on the [Visual Studio Marketplace][marketplace].

Should you encounter bugs or if you have feature requests, head on over to the [GitHub repo][repo] to open an issue if one doesn't already exist.

Pull requests are also very welcome, since I can't always get around to fixing all bugs myself.

- [Open Folder extensibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/open-folder?view=vs-2022) is pretty much the only documentation apart from the sample code folks have written (see [Acknowledgements](#Acknowledgements)).
